### Introduction

Codefuse-ModelCache is a semantic cache for large language models (LLMs). By caching pre-generated model results, it reduces response time for similar requests and improves user experience. <br />This project aims to optimize services by introducing a caching mechanism. It helps businesses and research institutions reduce the cost of inference deployment, improve model performance and efficiency, and provide scalable services for large models.  Through open-source, we aim to share and exchange technologies related to large model semantic cache.

## Architecture

![modelcache modules](docs/modelcache_modules_20240409.png)

## Quick start

You can find the start script in `flask4modelcache.py` and `flask4modelcache_demo.py`.

- `flask4modelcache_demo.py`: A quick test service that embeds SQLite and FAISS. No database configuration required.
- `flask4modelcache.py`: The standard service that requires MySQL and Milvus configuration.

### Dependencies

- Python: V3.8 or above
- Package installation

  ```shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt 
  ```

### Start service

#### Start demo

1. Download the embedding model bin file from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/shibing624/text2vec-base-chinese/tree/main). Place it in the `model/text2vec-base-chinese` folder.
2. Start the backend service:

  ```shell
  cd CodeFuse-ModelCache
  ```

  ```shell
  python flask4modelcache_demo.py
  ```

#### Start normal service

Before you start standard service, do these steps:

1. Install MySQL and import the SQL file from `reference_doc/create_table.sql`.
2. Install vector database Milvus.
3. Configure database access in:
   - `modelcache/config/milvus_config.ini`
   - `modelcache/config/mysql_config.ini`
4. Download the embedding model bin file from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/shibing624/text2vec-base-chinese/tree/main). Put it in `model/text2vec-base-chinese`.
5. Start the backend service:

    ```bash
    python flask4modelcache.py
    ```

## Visit the service

The service provides three core RESTful API functionalities: Cache-Writing, Cache-Querying, and Cache-Clearing.

### Write cache

```python
import json
import requests
url = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/modelcache'
type = 'insert'
scope = {"model": "CODEGPT-1008"}
chat_info = [{"query": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI code assistant and you must provide neutral and harmless answers to help users solve code-related problems."}, {"role": "user", "content": "‰Ω†ÊòØË∞Å?"}],
                  "answer": "Hello, I am an intelligent assistant. How can I assist you?"}]
data = {'type': type, 'scope': scope, 'chat_info': chat_info}
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
res = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json.dumps(data))
```

### Query cache

```python
import json
import requests
url = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/modelcache'
type = 'query'
scope = {"model": "CODEGPT-1008"}
query = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI code assistant and you must provide neutral and harmless answers to help users solve code-related problems."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who are you?"}]
data = {'type': type, 'scope': scope, 'query': query}

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
res = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json.dumps(data))
```

### Clear cache

```python
import json
import requests
url = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/modelcache'
type = 'remove'
scope = {"model": "CODEGPT-1008"}
remove_type = 'truncate_by_model'
data = {'type': type, 'scope': scope, 'remove_type': remove_type}

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
res = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json.dumps(data))
```

## Function comparison

We've implemented several key updates to our repository. We've resolved network issues with Hugging Face and improved inference speed by introducing local embedding capabilities. Due to limitations in SqlAlchemy, we've redesigned our relational database interaction module for more flexible operations. We've added multi-tenancy support to ModelCache, recognizing the need for multiple users and models in LLM products. Lastly, we've made initial adjustments for better compatibility with system commands and multi-turn dialogues.

## Features

In ModelCache, we incorporated the core principles of GPTCache. ModelCache has four modules: adapter, embedding, similarity, and data_manager.

- The adapter module orchestrates the business logic for various tasks, integrate the embedding, similarity, and data_manager modules.
- The embedding module converts text into semantic vector representations, and transforms user queries into vectors.
- The rank module ranks and evaluate the similarity of recalled vectors.
- The data_manager module manages the databases.

To make ModelCache more suitable for industrial use, we made several improvements to its architecture and functionality:

- [x] Architectural adjustment (lightweight integration): 
  - Embedded into LLM products using a Redis-like caching mode
  - Provided semantic caching without interfering with LLM calls, security audits, and other functions
  - Compatible with all LLM services
- [x] Multiple model loading:
  - Supported local embedding model loading, and resolved Hugging Face network connectivity issues
  - Supported loading embedding layers from various pre-trained models
- [x] Data isolation
  - Environment isolation: Read different database configurations based on the environment. Isolate  development, staging, and production environments.
  - Multi-tenant data isolation: Dynamically create collections based on models for data isolation, addressing data separation issues in multi-model/service scenarios within large language model products
- [x] Supported system instruction: Adopted a concatenation approach to resolve issues with system instructions in the prompt paradigm.
- [x] Long and short text differentiation: Long texts bring more challenges for similarity assessment. Added differentiation between long and short texts, allowing for separate threshold configurations.
- [x] Milvus performance optimization: Adjusted Milvus consistency level to "Session" level for better performance.
- [x] Data management:
  - One-click cache clearing to enable easy data management after model upgrades.
  - Recall of hit queries for subsequent data analysis and model iteration reference.
  - Asynchronous log write-back for data analysis and statistics
  - Added model field and data statistics field to enhance features

## Todo List
